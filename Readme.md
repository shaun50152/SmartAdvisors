# SmartAdvisors

A UTA course recommendation and degree planning app. Upload your transcript, choose your college and degree, set preferences, and get personalized professor and course recommendations — or sign in with Google to generate a full semester-by-semester degree plan.

## Supported Degrees

### College of Engineering
- Computer Science (CSE)
- Civil Engineering (CE)
- Electrical Engineering (EE)
- Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering (MAE)
- Industrial Engineering (IE)

> More colleges coming soon (Business, Science, Nursing, Liberal Arts). See `client/src/config/colleges.ts` to add new ones.

## Running Locally (Step-by-Step)

Follow these steps exactly. You need two terminals open — one for the frontend, one for the backend.

---

### Before You Start — Install These Once

If you don't have these already, install them first:

- **Git** — https://git-scm.com/downloads
- **Node.js 18+** — https://nodejs.org (choose the LTS version)
- **Python 3.10+** — https://www.python.org/downloads

To check if you have them, run:
```bash
git --version
node --version
python3 --version
```

---

### Step 1 — Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acmuta/SmartAdvisors.git
cd SmartAdvisors
```

> If you already cloned it before, just pull the latest:
> ```bash
> git pull
> ```

---

### Step 2 — Create the Frontend `.env` File

This file holds the Google Sign-In key. It is **not** in the repo (for security), so you have to create it manually. **You only do this once.**

1. Go into the `client` folder
2. Create a new file called `.env` (exactly that name, with the dot)
3. Paste this exact line into it (ask the team lead on Discord for the Client ID):

```
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

**Mac/Linux shortcut** (replace the ID with the real one):
```bash
echo "VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com" > client/.env
```

**Windows shortcut** (in Command Prompt):
```cmd
echo VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id-here.apps.googleusercontent.com > client\.env
```

> **Note:** Without this file, the guest flow still works — but Google Sign-In won't.

---

### Step 3 — Start the Frontend

Open **Terminal 1** and run:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

You should see something like:
```
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in ...ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser. Leave this terminal running.

---

### Step 4 — Start the Backend

Open **Terminal 2** and run:

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd server
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
python3 run.py
```

**Windows:**
```cmd
cd server
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r ..\requirements.txt
python run.py
```

You should see:
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Leave this terminal running too.

---

### Step 5 — You're Done

With both terminals running, go to **http://localhost:5173** in your browser. The app should be fully working.

> **Note:** You need both the frontend (port 5173) and backend (port 8000) running at the same time for the app to work.

---

### Next Time You Work on It

You don't need to redo everything. Just:

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
cd server
source venv/bin/activate     # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
python3 run.py
```

---

## App Flow

```
WelcomePage
├── Continue as Guest
│   └── UploadScreen → TranscriptReview → PreferenceForm → RecommendationDashboard
└── Sign In (Google) → LoginPage
    ├── New User
    │   └── UploadScreen → TranscriptReview → PreferenceForm → DegreePlanSetup → SemesterPlanView
    └── Returning User
        └── WelcomeBack (shows saved plan summary, progress bar, quick actions)
```

### Guest Mode
1. Upload transcript PDF
2. Select college → select degree (two cascading dropdowns)
3. Review parsed courses
4. Set professor preferences (extra credit, clear grading, etc.)
5. Get recommended courses + ranked professors

### Signed-In Mode (Google)
1. Sign in with Google
2. Upload transcript PDF
3. Select college → select degree
4. Review parsed courses
5. Set professor preferences
6. Choose elective focus areas (security, AI/ML, etc.) and pick courses for next semester
7. Set credit hour target and semester start
8. Get a full semester-by-semester degree plan to graduation
9. Plan is saved — returning users see a dashboard with progress and quick actions

---

## How It Works

### Algorithm Overview
- Parses transcript PDF to extract completed courses
- Expands completed set with transitive prerequisites and course equivalences (e.g., MATH 3313 ↔ IE 3301)
- Filters degree plan to find courses with all prerequisites satisfied
- Looks up professors from grade distribution and RateMyProfessors data
- Scores professors based on student preferences (extra credit, difficulty, tags, etc.)
- For degree plans: uses greedy topological scheduling to generate semester-by-semester plans

### Scoring Signals
- `quality_rating` — primary base score (0–5)
- `would_take_again` — strong trust signal, boosts/dampens base score
- `total_ratings` — confidence multiplier (fewer reviews = regress toward neutral)
- `difficulty_rating` — used when `clearGrading` preference is set
- `tags` — matched against actual RateMyProfessors tag strings

---

## Databases

All databases are included in the repo under `server/data/`. No external database setup needed.

| Database | Contents |
|---|---|
| `classes.db` | Degree plan tables for each major (ClassesForCE, ClassesForCSE, etc.) |
| `grades.sqlite` | UTA grade distribution data (course offerings, GPAs, instructor names) |
| `professors.db` | RateMyProfessors data (ratings, difficulty, tags) |

### Updating Degree Plans

To reload a specific degree plan from its CSV:
```bash
cd server
source venv/bin/activate
python3 app/scripts/load_degree_plan.py CSE   # or CE, EE, IE, MAE
```

To reload all degree plans:
```bash
python3 app/scripts/load_degree_plan.py
```

CSV format:
```
Formal Name,Course Name,Prerequisites,Corequisites,Requirement
CSE 1310,Introduction to Computers and Programming,[None],[None],required
CSE 4303,Computer Graphics,"CSE 3380, CSE 3318",[None],elective
```

### Adding a New Degree
1. Add the college/degree entry in `client/src/config/colleges.ts`
2. Create a CSV in `server/data/` (e.g., `ACCT Degree Plan CSV.csv`)
3. Run `python3 app/scripts/load_degree_plan.py ACCT`
4. The rest of the app picks it up automatically

## Google Sign-In Setup (for contributors)

Google Sign-In uses `@react-oauth/google`. The Client ID is free and requires no billing.

To create your own Client ID for local development:
1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a project → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen → External
3. APIs & Services → Credentials → Create OAuth Client ID → Web application
4. Add `http://localhost:5173` to Authorized JavaScript Origins
5. Copy the Client ID into `client/.env` as `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...`

- `docs(readme): clarify quickstart`

### Pull Requests
- Small, focused PRs preferred
- Link issues with `Fixes #123`
- Include testing steps and screenshots for UI changes

### Secrets
